My issues are the following:
I want to change the titles per graph from say "1" in the first graph to a text of my choosing.
I can't get rid of the bottom note "Graphs by group(countryname)
I want to change the label "EC_INDEX" to a text of my choosing.
1. Add value labels
2. Use the note("") option within the byopt() option
3. Use the label option within legend().

For example:
Code:
webuse grunfeld,clear
label define mylabel 1 "AAA" 2 "BBB" 3 "CCC"
label values com mylabel
xtline invest kstock, byopt(note("")) legend(label(1 "My new label"))
